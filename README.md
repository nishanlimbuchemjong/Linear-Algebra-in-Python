# Linear Algebra in Python

This repository provides implementations of various **Linear Algebra** concepts and algorithms using **Python**. It aims to provide a clear and concise codebase for mathematical operations commonly used in **Machine Learning (ML)**, **Artificial Intelligence (AI)**, and **Deep Learning (DL)**.

## Introduction

This repository contains Python implementations of key **Linear Algebra** topics such as matrix operations, vector arithmetic, determinants, eigenvalues, and eigenvectors. It is designed to help users learn the core mathematical concepts used in data science, machine learning, and AI systems, particularly when working with large datasets and mathematical models.

## Features

- **Matrix Operations**: Addition, subtraction, multiplication, and transposition.
- **Determinants**: Calculation of the determinant for matrices of various sizes.
- **Inverse of Matrices**: Methods to find the inverse of a square matrix.
- **Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors**: Calculation of eigenvalues and eigenvectors for square matrices.
- **Vector Operations**: Dot product, cross product, scaling, and normalization.
- **Advanced Linear Algebra Concepts**: Implementations of rank, trace, orthogonality, and diagonalization.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- A text editor or IDE of your choice (e.g., VS Code, PyCharm, or Jupyter Notebook)

### Steps
1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/Linear-Algebra-in-Python.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project folder:
    ```bash
    cd Linear-Algebra-in-Python
    ```

3. (Optional) Create and activate a virtual environment:
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

4. Install any necessary dependencies (if available) by checking the `requirements.txt` (if provided) or manually using:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/Linear-Algebra-in-Python.git
    ```
2. **Navigate into the project folder:**
    ```bash
    cd Linear-Algebra-in-Python
    ```
3. **Run individual scripts**: Each script in the `Matrices`, `Vectors`, and other directories can be executed independently to perform specific operations like matrix multiplication or determinant calculation. For example:
    ```bash
    python Matrices/determinant.py
    ```
4. **Modify and experiment with the code**: Feel free to add or change the matrices for different test cases.
