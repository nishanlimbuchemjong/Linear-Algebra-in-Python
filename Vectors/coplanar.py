"""
Coplanar Vectors:
    Three or more vectors are said to be coplanar if they lie within the same plane. 
    This means that the vectors do not span more than two dimensions, and we can find a plane that contains all of them.

Mathematically:
    Three vectors v1, v2, and v3 are coplanar if the scalar triple product of these vectors is zero. 
   
    The scalar triple product is calculated as:
        v1 â‹… (v2 X v3) = 0
    
    If this value is zero, then the vectors are coplanar. 
    If it is non-zero, the vectors are not coplanar (they span a 3D space).
